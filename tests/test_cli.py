"""Sanity check: `template-cli` is on PATH after `pip install`.

The wheel ships `template-cli[.exe]` as a raw script at
`<name>-<ver>.data/scripts/`, bundled in by the soldr PEP 517 backend's
`[tool.soldr.pep517] bundle-bins` (see `pyproject.toml` and
zackees/ci.yml#6 round 1, which replaced the earlier post-build
zipfile-injection step, `ci/build_wheel.py`). pip drops that script
straight into the venv's `Scripts/` (Windows) or `bin/` (POSIX)
directory. There is no Python shim in front of it — see #7 for why
`os.execv`-based launchers race the shell prompt on Windows.

This test is a *runtime contract* check: if a downstream user does
`pip install template-python-rust-cmd`, can they then run
`template-cli --version`? It probes PATH directly rather than the
package source tree, because the wheel-side delivery mechanism (raw
script) is fundamentally not visible from the source tree.

Per zackees/ci.yml#6 round 1, this test does NOT skip when the binary
is missing — it fails. `./test` (`ci/gates/test.py`) always installs
the project through the soldr backend before running pytest, so the
binary is expected to be on PATH by the time this file runs; a missing
binary means the packaging path broke, which is exactly what this test
exists to catch.

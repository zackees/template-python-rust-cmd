"""PEP 517 backend smoke: `uv build --wheel` through the soldr backend.

The `[build-system]` in pyproject.toml routes wheel builds through the
soldr backend (which drives a pinned maturin under a rustc-caching
wrapper). `ci/gates/test.py` also exercises the backend now (via `uv
sync`, which installs the project), but that's a full-project-sync
path; this gate specifically checks the `uv build --wheel` entry point
a downstream `pip install template-python-rust-cmd` (sdist build) or a
release job would use, without installing anything.

Linux-only: soldr's compile daemon cannot spawn on GHA macOS/Windows
runners (zackees/soldr#1300) — macOS fails with "embedded compile
dispatch failed after 30000ms budget: NotRunning" and Windows wedges
the step for ~an hour. On those platforms the gate skips (returns 0)
rather than burning an hour to report a known-upstream condition.
Re-enable everywhere once soldr#1300 is fixed.

"""Python static analysis via pylint.

zackees/ci.yml#6 round-4B (GEN-004): the fast lane runs `pylint` over
`src/`, `ci/`, `tests/`, `action/` -- a different signal than ruff's
(ruff catches unused imports/shadowing/unsorted imports fast; pylint
adds cross-module checks ruff doesn't do: unresolved attribute access,
too-many-locals/branches/statements complexity, duplicate code). Its
config lives in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.pylint.*]` tables (minimal,
itemized -- see that file's comment for what's disabled and why; never a
blanket `disable = "all"`).

Invoked via `uv run --no-project --with pylint`, same reasoning as
`ci/gates/ruff.py`: avoid triggering the maturin/soldr wheel build a
bare `uv run` would demand from the root `pyproject.toml`.

Requires the built `_native` extension to be importable (needed for
`extension-pkg-allow-list` to actually introspect it rather than merely
declare it, and to avoid `tests/` import-time failures) -- run this gate
after the `build` gate, same ordering `ci.sh`'s `GATE_ORDER` already
uses for `ruff`.

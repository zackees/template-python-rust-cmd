"""Inner PyO3-call benchmark loop, executed by the release-profile venv's
OWN python (`<venv>/bin/python3 ci/perf_pyo3_bench.py --iterations N`) --
NOT the outer system `python3` `ci/perf.py` itself runs under. Running
inside that venv is what makes the timed `import` resolve the actually
INSTALLED, compiled `_native` extension (the same wheel `ci/perf.py
bench` just built and installed), never this checkout's editable `src/`
tree.

zackees/ci.yml#6 round 5 deliverable 4: "a small, real benchmark of the
product ... a PyO3 call xN". Prints exactly ONE line of JSON to stdout
(a bare list of per-call second counts) -- `ci/perf.py`'s `bench`
subcommand is the only consumer and does all `BenchmarkRecord`/
dataclass assembly itself (AGENTS.md's typed-benchmark rule); this
script never touches a dataclass or writes a file, so it stays a
minimal, dependency-free timing loop.

# Architecture


Default `python3 ci/local.py act` requires a clean committed tree, uses the
shared gate's execution or fresh-result reuse, and amends HEAD on success.
See the [local-loop contract](../CLAUDE.md#ci).
Explicit title/job selections remain diagnostics; native and release coverage
remain required.

## Goal

Ship one Python wheel that exposes:

- a Python import surface backed by `PyO3` (`template_python_rust_cmd._native`)
- a command surface backed by a compiled Rust executable (`template-cli`,
  bundled into the wheel by the soldr PEP 517 backend at
  `template_python_rust_cmd-<ver>.data/scripts/` — pip extracts it
  straight into the venv's `Scripts/`/`bin/` on install, no Python
  launcher; see #7 for the Windows `os.execv` race that motivated this)

A consumer installs a single distribution and gets both deliverables.
A maintainer maintains one workspace and (eventually, once a later
round of [zackees/ci.yml#6](https://github.com/zackees/ci.yml/issues/6)
lands it) one generated CI matrix to feed both.

## CI Architecture

This template implements the canonical Rust+Python gate/hook shape
from [`zackees/zccache#835`](https://github.com/zackees/zccache/issues/835),
and is the fleet reference repo for the `rust-pypi-app` profile defined
in [`zackees/ci.yml#6`](https://github.com/zackees/ci.yml/issues/6).
Load-bearing pieces:

1. **`ci.toml`** (repo root). The CI contract: declared platforms, the
   Rust public/private crate split and test-binary budget, Python
   packaging shape, suites, flows, tags, cache families. Does not
   generate YAML — a future `ci-lint` (built in `zackees/ci.yml`)
   checks the repo against it and computes each run's plan.
2. **`./ci.py`.** PEP 723 dispatcher, directly executable via its
   `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --no-project --script` shebang. Every
   gate invocation goes through here so the `--no-project --script`
   flag combo (which suppresses the soldr-backend auto-build trap)
   lives in one place.
3. **`ci/gates/`.** Workspace-state checks. Each file exposes
   `def run() -> int`. Canonical ordering in `ci.py::GATE_ORDER`. Every
   Rust/wheel command goes through `soldr` — never bare `cargo`/`maturin`.
4. **`ci/hooks/`.** Agent-intent guards wired through
   `.claude/settings.json`. Only fires during Claude/Codex sessions.
5. **No `.github/workflows/` right now.** `zackees/ci.yml#6` round 1
   (this change) deleted the previous `ci.yml` — it queued a retired
   `macos-13` runner for 24h on every run and never passed. A later
   round adds `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (the only trigger-bearing
   workflow) + `ci-pre.yml` (workflow_call only), planned by
   `ci.toml`. Until then, `./ci.py all` locally is the equivalent.
6. **`action.yml` + `action/cleanup/action.yml`.** Composite action
   contract. Validated by `ci/gates/action_yaml.py` (structural) +
   `ci/gates/action_surface.py` (runtime binary surface match). Every
   `run:` step is one line calling a script under `action/` — no
   inline multi-line shell.

## Crate Responsibilities

### `crates/template` (public amalgam)

- **No logic of its own.** Every symbol is a `pub use` re-export from
  a crate under `crates/private/`.
- The only crate published to crates.io, and the only one
  `template-cli`/`template-py` depend on.
- Cargo features are `dep:` wiring only (`json = ["dep:template-json"]`)
  — never a behavioral `#[cfg(feature = ...)]` branch.

### `crates/private/template-core`

- pure Rust domain logic, `publish = false`
- no Python-specific concerns, no `[features]`
- reaches the OS only via `crate::platform::*` (aliased from
  `template-platform`)
- the unit of behavior consistency between the CLI and Python surfaces

### `crates/private/template-json`

- an optional capability (JSON encoding of the version banner) that is
  a whole crate, not a `#[cfg(feature)]` branch inside `template-core`
- no third-party dependencies — hand-rolled, deliberately

### `crates/private/template-platform`

- the host-platform facade: one `cfg_select!` selector (`lib.rs`), a
  cfg-free facility surface (`platform.rs` + `platform/**`), native
  code confined to `platforms/{windows,linux,macos}/**`
- the **only** crate allowed to select on host OS; every other crate
  reaches it through `pub(crate) use template_platform as platform;`

### `crates/template-cli`

- argument parsing (currently minimal), command execution
- stdout/stderr policy, exit-code policy
- depends on `template` (the amalgam) with the `json` ship feature —
  never on the private crates directly
- **subcommand/flag surface is part of the composite-action contract**
  — `ci/gates/action_surface.py` verifies `action.yml`'s scripts only
  reference surface actually present in `--help`

### `crates/template-py`

- `PyO3` module definitions (`#[pymodule]`, `#[pyfunction]`)
- Python-friendly value conversion
- thin translation layer over `template` (the amalgam) — no Rust test
  harness (`[lib] test = false, doctest = false`); tested from the
  Python side (`tests/test_bindings.py`)

### `src/template_python_rust_cmd`

- package version and re-exports (`__init__.py`)
- Python wrapper around the extension (`bindings.py`), no pure-Python
  fallback for `_native`
- `platforms/` — host-platform facade (Python side), mirroring the
  Rust crate of the same purpose
- typing stub for the PyO3 surface (`_native.pyi`)

The `template-cli` binary is intentionally NOT under the package — it
ships via `bundle-bins` (see Goal above). A Python caller that wants to
invoke the CLI from code should do
`subprocess.run([shutil.which("template-cli"), ...])`, not import
anything from this package.

## Hook / Gate Split

| Concern                                | Home                       |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Repo-state checks (every CI cycle)     | `ci/gates/*.py`            |
| Agent-intent checks (Claude sessions)  | `ci/hooks/*.py`            |
| File size budget (workspace-wide)      | `ci/gates/loc.py`          |
| File size budget (per-edit)            | `ci/hooks/loc_guard.py`    |
| README presence + size                 | `ci/hooks/readme_guard.py` |
| Bare cargo/maturin / unsafe `uv run` shape | `ci/hooks/tool_guard.py` |

## Non-goals

- duplicating core logic in Python
- embedding CLI-only behavior inside the `PyO3` module without an API
  use case
- maintaining separate CI infrastructure for the Python and Rust sides
- inline shell logic in any future workflow YAML, or in `action.yml`
- gates that hard-couple to the agent's session (those are hooks)
- a `#[cfg(feature = ...)]` branch inside a private crate's shared
  logic — features gate `dep:` wiring in `template` only

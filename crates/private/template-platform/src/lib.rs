//! The single place `template-platform` selects its host-platform
//! implementation.
//!
//! Every other crate in this workspace that needs to reach the OS aliases
//! this crate as `crate::platform` (`pub(crate) use template_platform as
//! platform;`) and calls only the neutral facade in [`host`]. No other
//! production source file in this workspace may choose the host with
//! `#[cfg(target_os = ...)]`, `#[cfg(windows)]`, `#[cfg(unix)]`, or
//! `cfg!(...)`, and no other crate may name a concrete `platforms::*`
//! implementation module directly.
//!
//! The `cfg_select!` block below is the **only** host-selection site in
//! this workspace. There is deliberately no fallback arm and no `unix`
//! arm: a host OS this crate does not implement fails to compile here,
//! loudly, rather than silently falling back to a guess.
//!
//! Pattern and wording adapted from soldr's `crates/soldr-platform/src/
//! lib.rs` (zackees/soldr issues #2493, #2498) and kernal-api's
//! `docs/platform-boundary.md`. This crate implements one real capability
//! (`host::os_name` + `host::exe_suffix`) rather than soldr's full
//! process/fs/ipc/executable/host surface — enough to prove the boundary
//! shape without a second native SDK dependency in the template.

"""Host-platform facade for the Python side of this repo.

Every host check — Windows vs. Linux vs. macOS, native executable
suffix — lives here and nowhere else. This mirrors the Rust
`template-platform` facade (`crates/private/template-platform`): one
neutral surface with real, host-specific answers, no `sys.platform`,
`os.name`, or `platform.system()` call anywhere else in the tree.

`ci.toml`'s `[allow] platform-code` lists two allowed locations for
native/host-branching code in this workspace:
`crates/private/template-platform/src/platforms/**` (Rust) and
`src/template_python_rust_cmd/platforms/**` (this package, Python).
Nothing else may call `sys.platform` / `os.name` / `platform.system()`
— that includes test files and the `ci/` build scripts, which import
this module the same way application code would (it has zero runtime
dependencies, so importing it never requires the `_native` extension
to be built).

Deliberately small: like the Rust side, this proves the boundary shape
with one real capability (executable suffix / OS name) rather than a
full platform SDK. Grow it here, not with an inline check somewhere
else, when a second one is needed.
